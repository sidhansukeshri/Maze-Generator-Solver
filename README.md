# MazeCraft

## Introduction
Welcome to MazeCraft! MazeCraft is a maze generator and solver application that helps you explore and conquer complex mazes with ease. It provides a user-friendly interface to generate mazes, solve them, and visualize the solution process step by step.

## Features
- Generate mazes of various sizes using recursive backtracking algorithm.
- Solve generated mazes using depth-first search algorithm with backtracking.
- Visualize the maze generation and solution process.
- Understand the maze solution path using a binary tree representation.

## Getting Started
To get started with MazeCraft, simply follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `maze.html` file in your web browser.
3. Click on the "Generate Maze" button to create a new maze.
4. Click on the "Solve Maze" button to solve the generated maze.
5. Explore the maze solution step by step.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Vis.js (for visualizing the binary tree)
